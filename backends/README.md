# OpenSAFELY backend server management

OpenSAFELY backends are deployed on servers inside our partners' secure
environments. These servers are provisioned and managed by the provider,
with limited network access. They are designed to run the
[job-runner](https://github.com/opensafely-core/job-runner) process,
which polls jobs.opensafely.org for work, and then runs the requested
actions securely inside docker containers. It generally also handles the
process for redaction, review and publication of outputs.

Due to being deployed in different partner's environments, and us not
always having full administrative control of that environment, each
backend is different in some way. We do try to minimise these
differences, but they are unavoidable.

## usage

To manage a backend run the script BACKEND/manage.sh as root. e.g.:

    sudo ./tpp/manage.sh

This will ensure the right packages, users, groups and configuration is set up
on that backend. 

Directory layout:

./scripts 	- various bash scripts to perform specific actions, designed to
            	  be idempotent
./tpp     	- scripts for tpp backend
./emis    	- scripts for emis backend
./keys/$USER 	- public keys to add to ssh for $USER

developers      - developers gh account list. To be replaced by
	          authenticated API call to job-server later, perhaps.


## Base assumptions

 * Ubuntu server (20.04 baseline)
 * Internet access to {jobs,docker-proxy}.opensafely.org
 * Internet access to an official ubuntu archive
 * Internet access github.com
 * SSH access for developers to the backend host
 * sudo access on the host in some form
 * Just bash and git needed on the host to bootstrap backend.


## Common goals for all backends

 * docker installed and configured appropriately
 * maintain developers' linux accounts and ssh keys
 * maintain level2/3/4 groups and membership of those groups
 * shared account for running each services, which developers can su to.
 * directories for high and medium privacy outputs, with access
 * controlled by groups


## Users and permissions

Users are created with their github account names, and their github public keys
added to authorized_keys. Additional non-Github registered public keys can be
added to keys/$USER in this repo if needed.

There are 3 groups to manage permissions:

developers: sudo access. Level 2 in opensafely terms.
researchers: read access to high privacy files. Level 3.
reviewers: read/write access to medium privacy files. level 4.

Note: Long-term, reviewers will not have local accounts, but instead review via a webapp.


## TPP 

The TPP environment:

 - The backend runs in a Hyper-V VM on a Windows host
 - behind an authenticated firewall
 - user access is managed by TPP at the windows host level
 - seperate level 4 server for level 4 access - files are currently
   copied across, and redaction happens there.

Implications:

 - developers need an SSH key on the windows host to log in to the
   backend server (RDP doesn't do agent forwarding!)
 - backend needs to write files to host files system for sync to level 4
   server, which requires an SMB mount in the backend.


# EMIS

EMIS is an ubuntu VM on AWS, and we have root access. So is simpler in
many ways to TPP. But we need to add a basic level 4 redaction process:

 - Give level 4 users local accounts with passwords.
 - allow RDP login to those accounts.
