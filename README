This repository contains the documentation and scripts used to manage
the OpenSAFELY Github organisation's users, teams, repos and
permissions.

Github's organisation features are somewhat limited. Repositories are
flat, no grouping, so each repo needs explicitly adding to a team, at an
explicit permissions level. This makes managing this via the UI
laborious and and error prone.

This repo include config and scripts to manage the teams and repos via
the Github API.

The high level goal to protect against injection of code via github into
any part of the OpenSAFELY systems. To reduce risk, we to separate the
sensitive infrastructure repos out from the ever-growing list of
study repos, and restrict write access to the senstive repos to a
smaller technical team.  As there is no repository grouping, this is
done via explicit config stored in this repo.

There are two teams. Researchers have admin access to all study repos.
Developers have admin access to all protected infrastructure repos, and
are also in Researchers team.

All master/main branches are protected, even for admins. This disables
force-pushes from anywhere.

Additionally, protected repos require code review, and signing. This
prevents pushes to master/main without a review.
