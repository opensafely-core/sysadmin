# Services
The configuration/deployment files for some small/simple services are stored in this directory, other slightly larger/more complicated services are stored in their own repositories. Please see also the following locations:

* [backends](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/sysadmin/tree/main/infra/backends) - a public holding page for our private backends, to help maintain TLS certificates
* [otel-gateway](./otel-gateway/README.md) - OpenTelemetry Collector Gateway
* [proxy](https://github.com/opensafely-core/proxy) - proxy to allow OpenSAFELY backends to safely access external data
